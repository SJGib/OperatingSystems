Assignment Report

For this assignment, we worked in a group of four utilising Github to share and combine several different portions of 
code. This allowed us to work as a dynamic team to quickly and concisely finish the assignment in a very efficient 
manner. For the assignment, we implemented the needed functionality of the shell lab. 
This included i-ix and 2-6: 
 - cd, changes directory
 - clr, clears the screen
 - dir, lists the contents of the directory
 - environ, lists environment strings
 - echo, prints to screen
 - help, display user manual
 - pause, pause shell until 'enter' is pressed
 - quit, exits shell
