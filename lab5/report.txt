We used OPENMP to create threads based on the number of customers. After creating the threads, we seed a random number generator and start each thread. Based on the thread number, we create a random need for each customer using the seed then each thread loops until the need is met. The need is reduced or increased based on a random generation that requests or releases resources. When any thread requests or releases resources, the system checks if the state is safe first. If it is, then it gives the resources or takes the resources from the thread. Otherwise the the thread repeatably makes the request (not randomly regenerating a new number) until it is allowed to take/give the resources back. If the request is not possible, the thread simply ends due to insufficient resources in the system.
